### Project Description: Exploratory Data Analysis on Marketing Campaigns

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a marketing dataset to uncover key insights that can guide strategic decision-making. The dataset contains 200,005 records covering various marketing campaigns, including ROI, Click-Through Rate (CTR), Cost Per Click (CPC), and Conversion Rate.  

The analysis follows a structured approach:  
1. **Data Understanding** – Reviewing dataset structure, key columns, and metrics.
   
2. **Initial Exploration** – Checking for missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
    
3. **Insight Generation** – Identifying high/low-performing campaigns, analyzing trends, and calculating CTR, CPC, and ROI.
   
4. **Data Visualization** – Using bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and heatmaps to present findings.
   
5. **Presentation & Reporting** – Summarizing insights in a well-structured Google Slides presentation, embedding visualizations and code snippets.
